# Amazon_product_review_sentiment_analysis
Build a deep learning model to classify product reviews by sentiment (positive, neutral, negative). This project covers the full NLP pipeline, from cleaning raw text to training a Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM/GRU). You'll master key concepts like tokenization and word embeddings to create a nuanced, real-world text classifier.
